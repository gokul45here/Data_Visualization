# Data-Analyst-Task-2: Superstore Sales Insights ‚Äì 2025

## üìä Project Overview
This project involves conducting a sales performance analysis using a Superstore sales dataset (or equivalent) to create a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI. The goal is to provide actionable insights into regional performance, product categories, and sales trends.

## üîë Key Deliverables
* **Data Preparation:** Cleaning, transformation, and creation of new metrics (`Profit Margin`, `Year`, `Discount Percentage`).
* **Dashboard:** A visually cohesive dashboard featuring 6 key charts for sales storytelling.
* **Insights:** Specific text-based narratives below each visual, summarizing the key findings.

## üìà Key Metrics & Calculations
* **Order Date:** Used to create trend analysis (`Year`, `Month/Year`).
* **Category:** Used `PRODUCTLINE` as a proxy.
* **Region:** Used `COUNTRY` as a proxy.
* **Profit (Assumption):** Calculated as `SALES * 0.20` (assuming a 20% Gross Profit Margin, as true profit/COGS data was missing).
* **Profit Margin:** Calculated as `Profit / Sales`.
* **Discount Percentage:** Calculated as `(MSRP - PRICEEACH) / MSRP`.
